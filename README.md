To-Do List v2.0 - This app is a simple To-Do List manager for day to day business. 
You can add items using the input bar on the bottom of the screen and remove items by long-clicking them. 
The app stores the data internally so your To-Do List gets saved and can be reaccessed later.
You can switch between lists by using the navigation drawer.
